- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Autoit and Python as well as general developer and computer science concepts
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects to build my skills and portfolio of works
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding projects to volunteer my time and energy into and contribute to someone else's hobby until I become competent enough to start my own 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything to do with aviation as I am a flying enthusiast and ex-military helicopter pilot
